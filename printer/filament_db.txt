# Filament database

This database is to store settings for filaments.ca filament that we use for 
production in Canada. It gives the ideal temperatures for each colour, as they 
slightly vary for optimal quality. All prints are done on MK2/MK3 style printers 
with E3D extruders.

Each colour is presented as follows: Colour: First layer temp / other layer temp

* Purple: 210/205
* Solid yellow: 210/203
* Dark orange: 210/205
