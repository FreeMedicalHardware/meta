Thank you, Future Crunch! With your help, the Glia team will be able to continue its important work. We make high-quality low-cost open-source medical devices that bring equal care to all regardless of where they are. Our projects run in Canada, Tunisia and the Gaza Strip. Your donations will bring stethoscopes to medical students in Gaza and tourniquets and training.

Thank you!
