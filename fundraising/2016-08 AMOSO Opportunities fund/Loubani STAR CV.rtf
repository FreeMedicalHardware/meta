Despite this, they remain expensive and therefore out of reach for health care providers and hospitals in the developing world and even poorer health centres in the developed world.\line \line Advances in rapid prototyping such as 3D printing and Free hardware licenses have recently allowed the local production of high quality medical hardware and devices for a fraction of the cost of proprietary alternatives. This research focuses on three key aspects:\line \line 1. The research, development and validation of medical devices such as a stethoscope, pulse oximeter, electrocardiogram and surgical tools.\line \line 2. The dissemination of plans, BOMs, and validation protocols for these devices\line \line 3.

Both have been studied and developed extensively, but often in isolation and with disdain for the other. We see this divide colloquially among our colleagues in psychiatry versus surgery, for example, or internal medicine versus public health.\line \line In medical school, students learn the clich{\'e9} of holistic healthcare, but few value it or know how to apply it by the time they graduate residency or enter practice.\line \line My goal, then, is to build up a solid foundation of facts and knowledge like teaching a poet his or her vocabulary. With that solid core, I teach the learner then that one question has to be answered in each clinical encounter: What is the best thing for the patient? With the vocabulary they have built up of of medical facts, statistics and algorithms, they must now write the poetry of their patient{\'92}s health.\line \line Creating a foundation from which learners can construct a holistic picture of their patients means simultaneously teaching the learner science and philosophy. Instead of simply giving a dehydrated patient IV fluid, it means understanding what an isotonic solution is and how one can achieve rehydration.\line \line In short, it means using algorithms to further goals, not to constrain judgement and free thought.\line \line To build an excellent base of knowledge, I believe in the free and open dissemination of knowledge and research using open access medical resources. To this end, I have contributed to open access medical resources such as grand round videos, lectures and materials.\line \line Academic medicine is a unique thought leader that deserves us trying to preserve its ideals.
